# Restaurant-Orders-SQL-analysis

This project involves analyzing restaurant order data using SQL. The dataset, provided by Maven Analytics, consists of two tables: `menu_items` and `order_details`. The analysis aims to uncover insights about sales trends, customer preferences, and ordering behavior.

## Project Overview

The dataset contains information about menu items, including their category and price, as well as detailed records of customer orders. The analysis is focused on answering key business questions such as:

1. What were the top 5 orders that spent the most money?
2. What were the least and most ordered items, and what categories were they in?
3. How many orders included more than 12 items?
4. Which orders contained the most items?

## Data Sources

- **`menu_items`**: Contains details about menu items, including ID, name, category, and price.
- **`order_details`**: Includes information about each order, such as order ID, date, time, and the items ordered.

## Key Insights

The analysis aims to help the restaurant understand customer behavior, optimize the menu, and improve operational efficiency.

## How to Use

The SQL queries for this analysis can be found in the project's files. They are designed to be run on the dataset to produce insights and support business decision-making.

## Acknowledgements

This dataset was sourced from Maven Analytics. The project is intended to demonstrate SQL analysis skills and provide insights into restaurant operations.
